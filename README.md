# 🛠️ My Dotfiles

This repo contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for setting up a development environment on macOS.

Managed with `git`, symlinked with `stow` (or manually), and regularly overthought.

## 💻 Contents

Includes configs for:

- `zsh`
- `nvim`
- `vim`
- `tmux` will add later
- `kitty`
- `starship.toml`
- Anything else I regret later

## 🚀 Installation

> Warning: This is designed for my system. May explode yours. YMMV.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:shubham14039/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
